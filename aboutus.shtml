<h2>If you can't reach us when you call on the phone, please don't worry!  It's because we're out working, and the nursery is in a dead spot, so we can't use cell phones there. We check all messages, every day. Please DO leave a message, and we'll get back to you.</td></tr>

<h2>Directions to the nursery, coming from Athens</h2>
<ol>
<li>Take US-33 to the Columbus Road / OH-550 / OH-13 exit, which is the first exit west of East State Street on the east side of Athens or the first exit east of Johnson Road in The Plains.
<li>Take the exit. If coming from the west, turn left onto OH-550. If coming from the east, turn right onto OH-550 at the light.
<li>Go 4.5 miles to the top of the dividing ridge. This is the only ridge you'll go over between Athens and Sharpsburg, so it's unmistakeable.
<li>Turn right on top of the dividing ridge onto Peach Ridge Road / Dutch Creek Road. You'll need to take this turn very slowly, and you'll go up very steeply at first.
<li>At the stop sign at the top of the hill, bear left onto Dutch Creek Road. This is a four-way intersection, with a driveway to the left (on the ridgetop), Peach Ridge Road to the right (on the ridgetop), and Dutch Creek Road ahead, slightly to the left, going down into the valley.
<li>At 0.5 mile from OH-550, turn into the first driveway to the right. Warning: This is a sharp turn. <strong>You're now at the nursery.</strong>
